<h3>15.1.2. Patch checklist<a class="headerlink" href="#patch-checklist" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Apart from running the tests, there&#8217;s a simple patch checklist that
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">make</span> <span class="pre">patchcheck</span></code> (or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">./python.exe</span> <span class="pre">Tools/scripts/patchcheck.py</span></code> on
Windows) will run through:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Are there any whitespace problems in Python files?
(using <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Tools/scripts/reindent.py</span></code>)</li>
<li>Are there any whitespace problems in C files?</li>
<li>Are there any whitespace problems in the documentation?
(using <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Tools/scripts/reindent-rst.py</span></code>)</li>
<li>Has the documentation been updated?</li>
<li>Has the test suite been updated?</li>
<li>Has <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Misc/NEWS</span></code> been updated?</li>
<li>Has <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Misc/ACKS</span></code> been updated?</li>
<li>Has <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">configure</span></code> been regenerated, if necessary?</li>
<li>Has <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pyconfig.h.in</span></code> been regenerated, if necessary?</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the automated patch check can&#8217;t actually <em>answer</em> all of these
questions, and even if it could, it still wouldn&#8217;t know whether or not
those answers were appropriate. Aside from the whitespace checks, it is just
a memory aid to help with remembering the various elements that can go into
making a complete patch.</p>

<div class="section" id="commit-style">
<h2>15.2. Commit Style<a class="headerlink" href="#commit-style" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once a change patch is ready and tested, it can be committed to the repository.
We usually prefer to put a whole feature or bugfix into a single commit, but no
more.  In particular:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Do <strong>not</strong> fix more than one issue in the same commit (except, of course, if
one code change fixes all of them).</li>
<li>Do <strong>not</strong> do cosmetic changes to unrelated code in the same commit as some
feature/bugfix.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is of course okay to pile up several commits to one branch and merge them
into another in one merge commit.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="handling-others-code">
<h2>15.3. Handling Others&#8217; Code<a class="headerlink" href="#handling-others-code" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As a core developer you will occasionally want to commit a patch created by
someone else. When doing so you will want to make sure of some things.</p>
<p>First, make sure the patch is in a good state. Both <a class="reference internal" href="patch.html#patch"><span>Lifecycle of a Patch</span></a> and
<a class="reference internal" href="tracker.html#helptriage"><span>Helping Triage Issues</span></a>
explain what is to be expected of a patch. Typically patches that get cleared by
triagers are good to go except maybe lacking <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Misc/ACKS</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Misc/NEWS</span></code>
entries.</p>
<p>Second, make sure the patch does not break backwards-compatibility without a
good reason. This means <a class="reference internal" href="runtests.html#runtests"><span>running the entire test suite</span></a> to
make sure everything still passes. It also means that if semantics do change
there must be a good reason for the breakage of code the change will cause
(and it <strong>will</strong> break someone&#8217;s code). If you are unsure if the breakage
is worth it, ask on python-dev.</p>
<p>Third, ensure the patch is attributed correctly by adding the contributor&#8217;s
name to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Misc/ACKS</span></code> if they aren&#8217;t already there (and didn&#8217;t add themselves
in their patch) and by mentioning &#8220;Patch by &lt;x&gt;&#8221; in the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Misc/NEWS</span></code> entry
and the checkin message. If the patch has been heavily modified then &#8220;Initial
patch by &lt;x&gt;&#8221; is an appropriate alternate wording.</p>
<p>If you omit correct attribution in the initial checkin, then update <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ACKS</span></code>
and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">NEWS</span></code> in a subsequent checkin (don&#8217;t worry about trying to fix the
original checkin message in that case).</p>
<p>Finally, especially for larger patches, check if the submitter of the
patch has a CLA in place (indicated by an asterisk following their username
in the issue tracker). If the asterisk is missing and the patch is
non-trivial, direct them to the electronic <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/psf/contrib/contrib-form/">Contributor Licensing Agreement</a>
to ensure the PSF has the appropriate authorizations in place to relicense
and redistribute their code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="contributor-licensing-agreements">
<h2>15.4. Contributor Licensing Agreements<a class="headerlink" href="#contributor-licensing-agreements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It&#8217;s unlikely bug fixes will require a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/psf/contrib/contrib-form/">Contributor Licensing Agreement</a>
unless they touch a <em>lot</em> of code. For new features, it is preferable to
ask that the contributor submit a signed CLA to the PSF as the associated
comments, docstrings and documentation are far more likely to reach a
copyrightable standard.</p>
<p>These days, the CLA can be signed electronically through the form linked
above, and this process is strongly preferred to the old mechanism that
involved sending a scanned copy of the signed paper form.</p>
<p>As discussed on the PSF <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/psf/contrib/">Contribution</a> page, it is the CLA itself that gives
the PSF the necessary relicensing rights to redistribute contributions under
the Python license stack. This is an additional permission granted above and
beyond the normal permissions provided by the chosen open source license.</p>
<p>Some developers may object to the relicensing permissions granted to the PSF
by the CLA. They&#8217;re entirely within their rights to refuse to sign the CLA
on that basis, but that refusal <em>does</em> mean we can&#8217;t accept their patches
for inclusion.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-s-new-and-news-entries">
<h2>15.5. What&#8217;s New and NEWS Entries<a class="headerlink" href="#what-s-new-and-news-entries" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Almost all changes made to the code base deserve an entry in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Misc/NEWS</span></code>.
If the change is particularly interesting for end users (e.g. new features,
significant improvements, or backwards-incompatible changes), an entry in
the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">What's</span> <span class="pre">New</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">Python</span></code> document (in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Doc/whatsnew/</span></code>) should be added
as well.</p>
<p>There are two notable exceptions to this general principle, and they
both relate to changes that <em>already</em> have a NEWS entry, and have not yet
been included in any formal release (including alpha and beta releases).
These exceptions are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If a change is reverted prior to release, then the corresponding entry
is simply removed. Otherwise, a new entry must be added noting that the
change has been reverted (e.g. when a feature is released in an alpha and
then cut prior to the first beta).</li>
<li>If a change is a fix (or other adjustment) to an earlier unreleased change
and the original NEWS entry remains valid, then no additional entry is
needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Needing a What&#8217;s New entry almost always means that a change is <em>not</em>
suitable for inclusion in a maintenance release. A small number of
exceptions have been made for Python 2.7 due to the long support period -
when implemented, these changes <em>must</em> be noted in the &#8220;New Additions in
Python 2.7 Maintenance Releases&#8221; section of the Python 2.7 What&#8217;s New
document.</p>
<p>New NEWS entries are customarily added at or near the top of their
respective sections, so that entries within a section appear in approximate
order from newest to oldest.  However, this is customary and not a
requirement.</p>
<p>The NEWS file is now read by Sphinx to produce the &#8220;Changelog&#8221; page; accordingly
it should be valid reStructuredText.  The &#8220;default role&#8221; (single backticks) can
be used to refer to objects in the documentation.  Example NEWS entry:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>- Issue #15304: Fix warning message when `os.chdir()` fails inside
  `test.support.temp_cwd()`.  Patch by Chris Jerdonek.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>(In all other <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.rst</span></code> files, the single backticks should not be used.  They are
allowed here because NEWS is meant to be as readable as possible unprocessed.)</p>
<p>A nice trick to make Mercurial’s automatic file merge work more smoothly is to
put a new entry after the first or first two entries rather than at the very
top.  This way if you commit, pull new changesets and merge, the merge will
succeed automatically.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="commit-messages">
<h2>15.6. Commit Messages<a class="headerlink" href="#commit-messages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Every commit has a commit message to document why a change was made and to
communicate that reason to other core developers. Python core developers have
developed a standard way of formatting commit messages that everyone is
expected to follow.</p>
<p>Our usual convention mimics that used in the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Misc/NEWS</span></code> file.  Actually,
it is common to simply paste the NEWS entry into the commit message.  Here
is an example:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>Issue #42: the spam module is now more spammy.
The spam module sporadically came up short on spam. This change
raises the amount of spam in the module by making it more spammy.
Thanks to Monty Python for the patch.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The first line or sentence is meant to be a dense, to-the-point explanation
of what the purpose of the commit is.  If this is not enough detail for a commit,
a new paragraph(s) can be added to explain in proper depth what has happened
(detail should be good enough that a core developer reading the commit message
understands the justification for the change).  Also, if a non-core developer
contributed to the resolution, it is good practice to credit them.</p>
<div class="section" id="mercurial-hooks">
<h3>15.6.1. Mercurial hooks<a class="headerlink" href="#mercurial-hooks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Special hooks have been added to the Mercurial repository to enable notifying
the issue tracker of a commit related to an issue.</p>
<p>A commit message can mention one or several issues in one of the following
ways:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>#12345
issue12345
issue 12345
bug12345
bug 12345
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>where 12345 is the number of the issue. The commit details (including its
changeset, branch and commit message) will then be posted as a message to the
issue&#8217;s page in the tracker, for each mentioned issue.</p>
<p>If &#8220;closes&#8221; (or &#8220;closed&#8221;, or &#8220;closing&#8221;) is prepended, the issue is
automatically closed as &#8220;fixed&#8221;.</p>

<h1>16. Working with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hg-scm.org/">Mercurial</a><a class="headerlink" href="#working-with-mercurial" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>As a core developer, the ability to push changes to the official Python
repositories means you have to be more careful with your workflow:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You should not push new named branches to the main repository.  You can
still use them in clones that you use for development of patches; you can
also push these branches to a <strong>separate</strong> public repository that will be
dedicated to maintenance of the work before the work gets integrated in the
main repository.</li>
<li>You should collapse changesets of a single feature or bugfix before pushing
the result to the main repository.  The reason is that we don&#8217;t want the
history to be full of intermediate commits recording the private history
of the person working on a patch.  If you are using the <a class="reference external" href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/RebaseExtension">rebase</a> extension,
consider adding the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--collapse</span></code> option to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hg</span> <span class="pre">rebase</span></code>.  The <a class="reference external" href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/CollapseExtension">collapse</a>
extension is another choice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of these constraints, it can be practical to use other approaches
such as <a class="reference external" href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/MqExtension">mq</a> (Mercurial Queues), in order to maintain patches in a single
local repository and to push them seamlessly when they are ready.</p>
<p>It can also be useful to keep a pristine clone of the main repository around,
as it allows simple reversion of all local changes (even &#8220;committed&#8221; ones) if
your local clone gets into a state you aren&#8217;t happy with.</p>
<div class="section" id="minimal-configuration">
<h2>16.1. Minimal Configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#minimal-configuration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To use Mercurial as a committer (both of your and others&#8217; patches), you should
set up some basic options in your <a class="reference external" href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/hgrc.5.html#files">configuration file</a>.  Under Windows,
TortoiseHg has a graphical settings dialog for most options, meaning you
don&#8217;t need to edit the file directly (it is still available in
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">%USERPROFILE%\Mercurial.ini</span></code>).  Under other platforms, you must edit
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.hgrc</span></code>.</p>
<p>Here are the minimal options you need to activate:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">your <em>username</em>: this setting defines the name that will be used when you
<a class="reference internal" href="faq.html#hg-commit"><span>commit</span></a> changes.  The usual convention is to also include
an e-mail contact address in there:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>[ui]
username = Your Name &lt;email@example.org&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>extended diffing</em>: this setting enables an <a class="reference external" href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/hg.1.html#diffs">extended diff format</a>
which is more useful than the standard unified diff format as it includes
metadata about file copies, permission bits, and is able to represent
binary files:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">diff</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">git</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">on</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Under Windows, you should also enable the <a class="reference external" href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/EolExtension">eol extension</a>, which will
fix any Windows-specific line endings your text editor might insert when you
create or modify versioned files.  The public repository has a hook which
will reject all changesets having the wrong line endings, so enabling this
extension on your local computer is in your best interest.</p>
<p>As a core developer, it can be very helpful to set up the same commit checks
locally that the main repo enforces for incoming patch sets. This can save a
great deal of frustration with the server rejecting <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hg</span> <span class="pre">push</span></code> for changes
(which can be especially time consuming if you have already merged changes
across branches).</p>
<p>Configuring and using the whitespace checking hook found in the <a class="reference external" href="https://hg.python.org/hooks">hooks
repository</a> will help check incoming patch sets. To configure a hook,
add configuration settings to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.hgrc</span></code> for the relevant repo(s) (remember
to adjust the path appropriately for the checked out location of the
<a class="reference external" href="https://hg.python.org/hooks">hooks repository</a>). To configure a &#8220;pretxncommit&#8221; hook that will check
whitespace before the changeset is committed and can thus abort the commit
if whitespace is found, add:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>[hooks]
pretxncommit.whitespace = python:~/path/to/checkwhitespace.py:check_whitespace_single
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Another option is to configure it as a &#8220;commit&#8221; hook; if used, a warning
will still be issued but the changeset will be applied anyway:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>[hooks]
commit = python:~/path/to/checkwhitespace.py:check_whitespace_single
</pre></div>
</div>

<div class="section" id="clones-setup">
<h2>16.2. Clones Setup<a class="headerlink" href="#clones-setup" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are several possible ways to set up your Mercurial clone(s).  If you are
a core developer, you often need to work on the different branches, so the best
approach is to have a separate clone/directory for each active branch.  If you
are a contributor, having a single clone might be enough.</p>
<div class="section" id="single-clone-approach">
<h3>16.2.1. Single Clone Approach<a class="headerlink" href="#single-clone-approach" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This approach has the advantage of being simpler because it requires a single
clone/directory, but, on the other hand, it requires you to recompile Python
every time you need to switch branch.  For this reason, this approach is not
suggested to core developers, but it&#8217;s usually suitable for contributors.</p>
<p>See <a class="reference internal" href="setup.html#checkout"><span>Getting the Source Code</span></a> to find information about cloning and switching branches.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="multiple-clones-approach">
<span id="multiple-clones"></span><h3>16.2.2. Multiple Clones Approach<a class="headerlink" href="#multiple-clones-approach" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This approach requires you to keep a separate clone/directory for each active
branch, but, on the other hand, it doesn&#8217;t require you to switch branches and
recompile Python, so it saves times while merging and testing a patch on the
different branches.  For this reason, this approach is suggested to core
developers.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this is by using the <a class="reference external" href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/ShareExtension">share extension</a>, that can be
enabled by adding the following lines to your <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.hgrc</span></code>:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>[extensions]
share =
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Once you have <a class="reference internal" href="setup.html#checkout"><span>cloned the hg.python.org/cpython repository</span></a>
you can create the other shared clones using:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ hg share cpython 2.7  # create a new shared clone
$ cd 2.7                # enter the directory
$ hg up 2.7             # switch to the 2.7 branch
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can then repeat the same operation for the other active branches.
This will create different clones/directories that share the same history.
This means that once you commit or pull new changesets in one of the clones,
they will be immediately available in all the other clones (note however that
while you only need to use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hg</span> <span class="pre">pull</span></code> once, you still need to use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hg</span> <span class="pre">up</span></code>
in each clone to update its working copy).</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t want to specify <a class="reference external" href="ssh://hg&#64;hg.python.org/cpython">ssh://hg&#64;hg.python.org/cpython</a> every time you pull
or push, you should add to the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.hg/hgrc</span></code> files of the clones:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>[paths]
default = ssh://hg@hg.python.org/cpython
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In order to apply a patch, commit, and merge it on all the branches, you can do
as follow:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ cd 2.7
$ hg pull
$ hg up
$ hg import --no-c http://bugs.python.org/url/to/the/patch.diff
$ # review, run tests, run `make patchcheck`
$ hg ci -m &#39;#12345: fix some issue.&#39;
$ # switch to 3.4 and port the changeset using `hg graft`
$ cd ../3.4
$ hg up
$ hg graft 2.7
$ # switch to 3.x, merge, commit, and push everything
$ cd ../3.x
$ hg up
$ hg merge 3.4
$ hg ci -m &#39;#12345: merge with 3.4.&#39;
$ hg push
</pre></div>

<p>There are two separate lines of development: one for Python 2 (the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">2.x</span></code>
branches) and one for Python 3 (the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">3.x</span></code> branches and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">default</span></code>).
You should <em>never</em> merge between the two major versions (2.x and 3.x) &#8212;
only between minor versions (e.g. 3.x-&gt;3.y).  The merge always happens from
the oldest applicable branch to the newest branch within the same major
Python version.</p>

<p>Assume that Python 3.5 is the current in-development version of Python and that
you have a patch that should also be applied to Python 3.4.  To properly port
the patch to both versions of Python, you should first apply the patch to
Python 3.4:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>cd 3.4
hg import --no-commit patch.diff
# Compile; run the test suite
hg ci -m &#39;#12345: fix some issue.&#39;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then you can switch to the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">3.5</span></code> clone, merge, run the tests and commit:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>cd ../3.5
hg merge 3.4
# Fix any conflicts (e.g. ``hg revert -r default Misc/NEWS``); compile; run the test suite
hg ci -m &#39;#12345: merge with 3.4.&#39;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you are not using the share extension, you will need to use
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hg</span> <span class="pre">pull</span> <span class="pre">../3.4</span></code> before being able to merge.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Even when porting an already committed patch, you should <em>still</em> check the
test suite runs successfully before committing the patch to another branch.
Subtle differences between two branches sometimes make a patch bogus if
ported without any modifications.</p>

<p>Assume you just committed something on <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">2.7</span></code>, and want to port it to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">3.4</span></code>.
You can use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hg</span> <span class="pre">graft</span></code> as follow:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>cd ../3.4
hg graft 2.7
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This will port the latest changeset committed in the 2.7 clone to the 3.4 clone.
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hg</span> <span class="pre">graft</span></code> always commits automatically, except in case of conflicts, when
you have to resolve them and run <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hg</span> <span class="pre">graft</span> <span class="pre">--continue</span></code> afterwards.
Instead of the branch name you can also specify a changeset id, and you can
also graft changesets from 3.x to 2.7.</p>
<p>On older version of Mercurial where <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hg</span> <span class="pre">graft</span></code> is not available, you can use:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>cd ../3.4
hg export 2.7 | hg import -
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The result will be the same, but in case of conflict this will create <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.rej</span></code>
files rather than using Mercurial merge capabilities.</p>
<p>A third option is to apply manually the patch on <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">3.4</span></code>.  This is convenient
when there are too many differences with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">2.7</span></code> or when there is already a
specific patch for <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">3.4</span></code>.</p>

<h2>16.7. Long-term development of features<a class="headerlink" href="#long-term-development-of-features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you want to work on a feature long-term (perhaps you&#8217;re implementing a
PEP), you will probably want to publish your work in a dedicated repository.
The following instructions will help you do so on <a class="reference external" href="https://hg.python.org">hg.python.org</a>&#8216;s infrastructure without requiring a lot of upload
bandwidth.</p>
<p>Go to the main repository&#8217;s Web page (<a class="reference external" href="https://hg.python.org/cpython/">https://hg.python.org/cpython/</a>); there
you find a button labelled &#8220;server-side clone&#8221;, which you can click on to
display a Web form.  Enter the relative path of the repository you want to
create on the server, for example <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">features/mywork</span></code>; and press the button.
A new repository gets created on the server with all the changesets of the
original repository (it will seem very fast; this is normal).</p>
<p>You can now do a local clone of this repository on your disk:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ hg clone ssh://hg@hg.python.org/features/mywork
$ cd mywork
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It is recommended that you create a new <a class="reference external" href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/NamedBranches">named branch</a> for your work, so as
to easily track changes.  That named branch will exist in your feature
repository, but not in the main repository:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ hg branch mywork
$ hg commit -m &quot;Creating branch mywork&quot;
$ hg push --new-branch
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can now work on your feature, commit changes as you will, and push them
when desired:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ hg push
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When you push them, they will land in the public repository at
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ssh://hg&#64;hg.python.org/features/mywork</span></code> (or
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">https://hg.python.org/features/mywork</span></code> for the read-only URL).  Other
people can clone the public repository and work on the code too.</p>
<p>When you want to synchronize with CPython&#8217;s upstream changes, you can pull
from the main repository, either from its remote URL:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ hg pull https://hg.python.org/cpython
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>or from a local clone that you may have on your disk (which is of course
faster):</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ hg pull ../cpython
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>and merge all new changes from branch <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">default</span></code> to branch <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mywork</span></code>:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ hg branch
mywork
$ hg merge default
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Rather than using a clone on <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python.org</span></code> (which isn&#8217;t particularly useful
for collaboration with folks that don&#8217;t already have CPython commit rights),
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.bitbucket.org">Bitbucket</a> also maintain an <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/mirror/cpython/overview">up to date clone</a> of the main <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cpython</span></code>
repository that can be used as the basis for a new clone or patch queue.</p>
<div class="section" id="uploading-a-patch-for-review">
<h3>16.7.1. Uploading a patch for review<a class="headerlink" href="#uploading-a-patch-for-review" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In this scheme, your work will probably consist of many commits (some of
them merges).  If you want to upload a patch for review somewhere, you need
a single aggregate patch.  This is where having a dedicated named branch
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mywork</span></code> gets handy.</p>
<p>First ensure that you have pulled <em>and merged</em> all changes from the main
repository, as explained above.  Then, assuming your <a class="reference internal" href="faq.html#hg-current-branch"><span>currently checked
out branch</span></a> is still <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mywork</span></code>, simply do:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ hg diff -r default &gt; mywork.patch
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This will write to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mywork.patch</span></code> all the changes between <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">default</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mywork</span></code>.</p>
