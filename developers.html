    </hgroup>
    <article class="">
      <p>This file is a running log of developers given commit privileges for Python.</p>
<p>The purpose is to provide some institutional memory of who was given access
and why.</p>
<p>The first entry starts in April 2005.  In keeping with the style of Misc/NEWS,
newer entries should be added to the top.  Entries should include the initials
of the project admin who made the change or granted access.  The procedure for
adding or removing users is described in <a class="reference internal" href="#altering-access"><span>Procedure for Granting or Dropping Access</span></a>.</p>
<p>Note, when giving new commit permissions, be sure to get a contributor agreement
from the committer.  See <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/psf/contrib/">http://www.python.org/psf/contrib/</a> for details.  When
the agreement is signed, please note it in this log.  SSH keys of the committer
should be sent to <a class="reference external" href="mailto:hgaccounts&#37;&#52;&#48;python&#46;org">hgaccounts<span>&#64;</span>python<span>&#46;</span>org</a>.</p>
<p>This file is encoded in UTF-8.  If the usual form for a name is not in
a Latin or extended Latin alphabet, make sure to include an ASCII
transliteration too.</p>

      <p>To be granted the ability to manage SSH keys for committers, you must first
submit a pull request to the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/psf-salt/blob/master/salt/hg/config/hg-account-admins">psf-salt repo</a>
to add your own SSH key to the hgaccounts account.</p>
<p>Once you have been added to the hgaccounts accout, obtain a checkout of the keys
repo:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>hg clone ssh://hgaccounts@hg.python.org/repo
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The key files are stored in the form <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">first.last</span></code>. Simply create or remove the
appropriate file, commit the change, and push. A hook on the server should
automatically regenerate the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">authorized_keys</span></code> file for the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hg</span></code> user. Make
sure to update the developer log above.</p>
